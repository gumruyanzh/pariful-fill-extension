━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 3: TEST WITH ONE EVENT (2 MINUTES)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before running batch automation, test with ONE event:

1. Copy a Partiful event URL:
   Example: https://partiful.com/e/abc123

2. In Settings → Scroll to "Automation Queue" section

3. Paste the URL in the textarea

4. Click "Save automation settings"

5. Click "Start queue"

6. Watch the log appear below:
   "Starting automation for 1 event(s)..."
   "Opened tab 123 for https://..."
   "Tab 123 completed: Filled 8 questions | Skipped 2"

7. Review what was filled/skipped in the log

8. Adjust your settings if needed


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 4: RUN BATCH AUTOMATION! 🚀
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now you're ready for the real deal!

1. Collect all your Partiful event URLs

2. Paste them in the "Automation Queue" textarea
   ONE URL PER LINE:
   
   https://partiful.com/e/abc123
   https://partiful.com/e/def456
   https://partiful.com/e/ghi789
   ...

3. Click "Save automation settings"

4. Click "Start queue"

5. Sit back and watch! ✨

The extension will:
✅ Open each event automatically
✅ Fill RSVP and questionnaire
✅ Submit automatically
✅ Retry failures up to 3 times
✅ Log detailed results

Final summary:
"Automation queue finished: 47 completed, 3 failed"


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 UNDERSTANDING RESULTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SUCCESS:
"Completed: Questionnaire submitted | Filled: 8 questions | Skipped: 2"
→ Event RSVP'd successfully, most questions answered

⚠️  RETRY:
"Retry 2/3: Filled: 3 questions | Missing dropdowns: Job title"
→ Extension retrying automatically, update "Job title" preference

❌ FAILED:
"Failed after 3 attempts: RSVP button not found"
→ Needs manual review, unusual event layout


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ "Questions skipped - no matching data"
FIX: Fill in profile fields or add custom question rules

❌ "Missing dropdowns: XYZ"
FIX: Check spelling in dropdown preferences matches EXACTLY

❌ Automation not starting
FIX: Enable "Auto-click Continue" in RSVP settings

❌ Slow/timing issues
FIX: Increase "Open tab stay duration" to 7000-10000ms
