## What You'll See

### Successful Autofill
‚úÖ `"Completed: Questionnaire submitted | Filled: 8 questions | Skipped: 2"`

**Means:**
- RSVP selected and submitted
- 8 questions answered
- 2 questions skipped (no matching data)

### Retry on Failure
‚ö†Ô∏è `"Retry 2/3: Filled: 3 questions | Missing dropdowns: Stage"`

**Means:**
- Some fields failed
- Extension will retry automatically
- Check your "Stage" dropdown preference

### Permanent Failure
‚ùå `"Failed after 3 attempts: RSVP button not found"`

**Means:**
- Event has unusual layout
- Manual RSVP needed

---

## Common First-Time Issues

### ‚ùå "Fields not being filled"
**Fix:** Check spelling in dropdown preferences matches EXACTLY with event options
- Wrong: `Founder/CEO`
- Right: `Founder` (use fallbacks for alternatives)

### ‚ùå "Questions skipped - no matching data"
**Fix:** Either:
1. Fill profile field (email, name, company, etc.)
2. Or create custom question rule for that specific question

### ‚ùå "Automation not starting"
**Fix:** Make sure "Auto-click Continue" is **ON** in RSVP settings

---

## Test With One Event First!

Before running 50 events:
1. Add just **1 event URL**
2. Click "Start queue"
3. Watch the log to see what gets filled/skipped
4. Adjust your settings based on results
5. Then run the full batch!

## You're Ready! üéâ

Your extension will now:
- ‚úÖ Open each event automatically
- ‚úÖ Fill RSVP (Going + attendee count)
- ‚úÖ Answer questionnaire based on your profile
- ‚úÖ Match dropdown options intelligently
- ‚úÖ Auto-submit (if enabled)
- ‚úÖ Retry failures up to 3 times
- ‚úÖ Log detailed results

**Time saved:** ~2-3 minutes per event!
