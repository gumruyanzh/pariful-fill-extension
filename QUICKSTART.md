## What You'll See

### Successful Autofill
✅ `"Completed: Questionnaire submitted | Filled: 8 questions | Skipped: 2"`

**Means:**
- RSVP selected and submitted
- 8 questions answered
- 2 questions skipped (no matching data)

### Retry on Failure
⚠️ `"Retry 2/3: Filled: 3 questions | Missing dropdowns: Stage"`

**Means:**
- Some fields failed
- Extension will retry automatically
- Check your "Stage" dropdown preference

### Permanent Failure
❌ `"Failed after 3 attempts: RSVP button not found"`

**Means:**
- Event has unusual layout
- Manual RSVP needed

---

## Common First-Time Issues

### ❌ "Fields not being filled"
**Fix:** Check spelling in dropdown preferences matches EXACTLY with event options
- Wrong: `Founder/CEO`
- Right: `Founder` (use fallbacks for alternatives)

### ❌ "Questions skipped - no matching data"
**Fix:** Either:
1. Fill profile field (email, name, company, etc.)
2. Or create custom question rule for that specific question

### ❌ "Automation not starting"
**Fix:** Make sure "Auto-click Continue" is **ON** in RSVP settings

---

## Test With One Event First!

Before running 50 events:
1. Add just **1 event URL**
2. Click "Start queue"
3. Watch the log to see what gets filled/skipped
4. Adjust your settings based on results
5. Then run the full batch!

---

## You're Ready! 🎉

Your extension will now:
- ✅ Open each event automatically
- ✅ Fill RSVP (Going + attendee count)
- ✅ Answer questionnaire based on your profile
- ✅ Match dropdown options intelligently
- ✅ Auto-submit (if enabled)
- ✅ Retry failures up to 3 times
- ✅ Log detailed results

**Time saved:** ~2-3 minutes per event!

---

## Next Steps

### View Detailed Logs
All actions are logged:
- What was filled
- What was skipped
- Why it was skipped
- Dropdown matching results

### Fine-tune Settings
After first run:
- Add more dropdown preferences for commonly skipped questions
- Create custom question rules for specific prompts
- Adjust timing if pages load slowly

### Handle Failures
Review failed events:
- Check automation log for reason
- Update settings if needed
- Re-run just those URLs
