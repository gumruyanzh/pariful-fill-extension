# Extension Improvements - Settings & Autofill Correctness

## Summary
Fixed critical correctness issues in batch automation and settings management to ensure accurate success reporting, proper retry logic, and future-proof settings updates.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Real Autofill Success Tracking ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Content script always reported `success: true` regardless of actual autofill outcome.

**Solution:**
- Added `fillTracker` object to track:
  - RSVP fields filled (choice, attendee count, comment)
  - Questions filled, skipped, and failed
  - Dropdown selection failures with field names
  - Detailed action log for debugging
- Modified all fill functions to return success/failure status
- Calculate real success: `filled > 0 && no critical failures`
- Enhanced logging: `"Filled: 5 questions | Skipped: 2 | Failed: 1 | Missing dropdowns: Stage"`

**Impact:** You now get accurate completion status and can identify which events need manual review.

### 2. Retry Logic for Failed Events ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Failed automation items were marked complete; no retry mechanism existed.

**Solution:**
- Added automatic retry up to 3 attempts per event
- Track attempt count and retry with detailed logging
- Mark as `failed` only after exhausting all retries
- Log shows: `"Failed, will retry (attempt 2/3): Filled: 0 questions | Skipped: 5"`
- Final summary: `"Automation queue finished: 47 completed, 3 failed"`

**Impact:** Temporary failures (network issues, timing problems) are retried automatically.

### 3. Settings Merge Fixed for Updates ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `deepMerge` replaced entire arrays, preventing users from receiving new default rules in extension updates.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `mergeArrayById()` function for `dropdowns` and `questions` arrays
- Logic:
  - Keep user-customized items (differ from defaults)
  - Add new default items not in user's settings
  - Preserve user-added items (custom IDs)
- Applied to both `background.js` and `options.js`

**Impact:** Extension updates can ship new helpful defaults without wiping user customizations.

### 4. Improved Dropdown Selection Reliability ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Race conditions in dropdown selection; immediate search before dropdown opened; used slow polling.

**Solution:**
- Two-phase approach:
  1. Wait for dropdown to open (check for visible options, 1s timeout)
  2. Search for matching option every 100ms (3s timeout)
- Added `isElementVisible()` check to verify options are actually clickable
- Better error reporting when no match found

**Impact:** Fewer dropdown failures, especially on slower pages or complex dropdowns.

## Files Modified

1. **`content/partiful.js`** (main changes)
   - Added `fillTracker` initialization
   - Created `createFillTracker()` function
   - Modified `handleRsvpModal()` to track RSVP selections
   - Updated `setInputValue()` to return success status
   - Enhanced `selectDropdownValue()` with callback and visibility checks
   - Modified `fillQuestionnaire()` to track each question's result
   - Rewrote `notifyAutomation()` to calculate real success and send detailed summary
   - Added `isElementVisible()` helper function

2. **`background.js`**
   - Modified `handleAutomationCompletion()` to implement retry logic (max 3 attempts)
   - Added completion summary with success/fail counts
   - Implemented `mergeArrayById()` for ID-based array merging
   - Updated `deepMerge()` to use `mergeArrayById()` for dropdowns/questions

3. **`options/options.js`**
   - Implemented `mergeArrayById()` for ID-based array merging
   - Updated `deepMerge()` to use `mergeArrayById()` for dropdowns/questions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Batch Automation:**
   - Add 5-10 test event URLs
   - Include events with different questionnaire types
   - Check automation log for detailed fill reports
   - Verify failed events are retried

2. **Test Settings Persistence:**
   - Add custom dropdown rule
   - Save settings
   - Simulate extension update (add new default rule to code)
   - Verify both custom and new default exist

3. **Test Dropdown Selection:**
   - Test with events having complex dropdowns
   - Test with non-matching options (should log failure)
   - Test with multiple fallback options

## Usage

Your extension now provides detailed feedback:

```
‚úÖ Questionnaire submitted automatically. | Filled: 8 questions | Skipped: 2
‚ùå Failed: RSVP button not found | Filled: 0 questions | Skipped: 5 | Missing dropdowns: Job title, Stage
üîÑ Retry 2/3: Filled: 3 questions | Failed: 2 | Missing dropdowns: Stage
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add "Test Autofill" button in options page to verify configuration
2. Add settings validation (warn if profile fields empty)
3. Export automation results as CSV
4. Add success/failure statistics dashboard
5. Implement configurable retry count

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible.
