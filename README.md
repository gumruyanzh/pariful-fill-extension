## Automation Example

```
Starting automation for 50 event(s)...

✅ Event 1: Questionnaire submitted | Filled: 8 questions | Skipped: 2
✅ Event 2: Questionnaire submitted | Filled: 6 questions | Skipped: 1  
⚠️  Event 3: Retry 1/3 | Filled: 3 questions | Missing dropdowns: Stage
✅ Event 3: Questionnaire submitted | Filled: 6 questions | Skipped: 0
❌ Event 4: Failed after 3 attempts | RSVP button not found
...

Automation queue finished: 47 completed, 3 failed.
```

## How It Works

1. **Background Worker** - Manages automation queue and opens tabs
2. **Content Script** - Auto-fills forms on Partiful pages
3. **Options Page** - Configure profile and automation settings

**Question Matching Priority:**
1. Custom question rules (exact/contains/regex)
2. Dropdown rules (label matchers)
3. Profile field mapping (email, name, LinkedIn, etc.)
